# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- Examples
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: Janurary 2nd, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CTCI problems, and put some thought into what I'll be starting on tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Trying to figure out where to start with my project and what all I will need to know in order to build it. I think I've settled on working on this
barcode review app that will allow me to scan any item in a store and aggregate reviews. Things I need to think about regarding it: UI, database/hosting a server,
api's for reviews.

### Day 1: Janurary 3nd, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Researched how to open up the camera to scan a barcode. Managed to get a few lines written but was unable to get the app to scan any barcodes.

**Thoughts:** So I was kind of expecting this hour to go something like this: I would start writing some lines of code, realize I don't know how to do something, quickly look it up then jump right back into the code, rinse and repeat. It was something like that, where I opened up Android Studio to the project I started, figured out my next step, then spent 2 hours researching with maybe a line of code to show for it. So I'm realizing that this will be a slower process than I originally thought. Which I also need to realize, is just part of the learning process. I don't know how to do all of this yet, so I will be spending more time researching than coding to begin with.
