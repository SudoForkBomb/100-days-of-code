# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- Examples
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: January 2nd, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CTCI problems, and put some thought into what I'll be starting on tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Trying to figure out where to start with my project and what all I will need to know in order to build it. I think I've settled on working on this
barcode review app that will allow me to scan any item in a store and aggregate reviews. Things I need to think about regarding it: UI, database/hosting a server,
api's for reviews.

### Day 1: January 3nd, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Researched how to open up the camera to scan a barcode. Managed to get a few lines written but was unable to get the app to scan any barcodes.

**Thoughts:** So I was kind of expecting this hour to go something like this: I would start writing some lines of code, realize I don't know how to do something, quickly look it up then jump right back into the code, rinse and repeat. It was something like that, where I opened up Android Studio to the project I started, figured out my next step, then spent 2 hours researching with maybe a line of code to show for it. So I'm realizing that this will be a slower process than I originally thought. Which I also need to realize, is just part of the learning process. I don't know how to do all of this yet, so I will be spending more time researching than coding to begin with.

### Day 2: January 4th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Found a better guide and got a better understanding of the barcode library.

**Thoughts:** I felt like I made a lot more progress compared to yesterday. I managed to get a lot more code down thanks to a guide that helped explain things a bit better. However, I was unable to get the camera to start or detect anything. I believe it may have something to do either the permissions, or the intent. I'll try to focus on more debugging tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the app permission to get the camera working. Added the Retrofit library, and started on the code to pass the UPC number to an API and return the information.

**Thoughts:** Picking up speed now. I was able to quickly find out why my camera wasn't working in the app early today (Had to go into the app's settings and turn on the permission), but wasn't able to work on any code until later tonight. I decided my next step should be to setup RetroFit to call an API and get information about the barcode number. I found a UPC database that I hope will large enough to get any barcode I send it. I'm hoping to be done with the Retrofit part tomorrow, so I can start testing some this weekend.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Not as productive as I was hoping. Tried getting Retrofit to work, but was unable to. Need to look do more research into it.

**Thoughts:** I waited too late at night to start working on this, and so I'm struggling with staying awake and trying to remember how I managed to get Retrofit to work when I used it several months ago. I was able to get a little bit of code down, but I'm going to have to do a lot more tomorrow to get things working.

### Day 5: January 7th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with some of the layout settings and worked on getting Retrofit working.

**Thoughts:** So I'm getting to the point where I realize I need to spend more time in Udacity or looking at some other Android tutorials. I've forgotten a lot of what I learned through the Udacity course and now I'm now spending a lot of time going back through stuff I should know how to do. I'll plan to spend more time in tutorials next week while I work on this.
As far as progress of my app, Retrofit isn't properly getting the UPC API, so the app is currently crashing whenever I scan a barcode. More to work on tomorrow.
